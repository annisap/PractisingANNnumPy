# Practicing on Feedforward Neural Networks and NumPy Python library

This is a project developed by Stephen Welch.
It is a feedforward neural network that predicts your test score based on the hours you slept and hours you studied.
Feedforward, Backforward, BFGS, and Regularization are the main concepts of the code files.
The model is built so as to gain experience on numPy library and feedforward networks. Hence the many comments regarding numpy and neural networks.
The the awesome tutorials and the original code can be found [here](https://github.com/stephencwelch/Neural-Networks-Demystified).

## Requirements

To run the project, it is required that the following are installed in your system:

- [anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/navigator)
- [Pyhton](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) version: "^2.7"
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) version: "^1.11.3"
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) version: "^2.02"

If anaconda is installed, then you do not have to install python and the packages since they are already included in anaconda.
